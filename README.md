# MovieTicketReservationSystem
This project is one of the works from my postgraduate course, Software Design &amp; Development. I built this movie tickets reservation system referring to Broadway using Spring Boot, MySQL, and MyBatis.

## Here are the key features of this software:

### 1. User Management:
#### ○ Users can register and create an account.
#### ○ Users can log in and authenticate themselves.
### 2. Ticket Reservation:
#### ○ Users can browse through the websites for available movies and showtimes.
#### ○ Users can select a movie and showtime and reserve it.
#### ○ Users will receive an email to confirm successful reservation.
### 3. Booking Management:
#### ○ Admin users can search, update, and delete booking information from the system.
