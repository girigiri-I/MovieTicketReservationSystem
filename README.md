# MovieTicketReservationSystem
This project is one of the works from my postgraduate course, Software Design &amp; Development. I built this movie tickets reservation system referring to Broadway using Spring Boot, MySQL, and MyBatis.

Here are the key features of this software:
● User Management:
  ○ Users can register and create an account.
  ○ Users can log in and authenticate themselves.
● Ticket Reservation:
  ○ Users can browse through the websites for available movies and showtimes.
  ○ Users can select a movie and showtime and reserve it.
  ○ Users will receive an email to confirm successful reservation.
● Booking Management:
  ○ Admin users can search, update, and delete booking information from the
  system.
